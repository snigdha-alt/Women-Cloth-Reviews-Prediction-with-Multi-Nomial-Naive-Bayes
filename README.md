# Women-Cloth-Reviews-Prediction-with-Multi-Nomial-Naive-Bayes
The multinimial Navies Bayes Classifier is suitable with classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification). The multinomial distribution normally requires integer feature counts. However, In practice, Fractional counts such as tf-idf may also work.

To predict women's clothing reviews using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier in Python, you'll need to follow a few steps. These include importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and test sets, and then building and evaluating the model. Let's assume you have a dataset of women's clothing reviews with features like review text and labels like positive or negative.

Here's a sample Python code implementing Multinomial Naive Bayes for women's clothing reviews:

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Step 2: Import Required Libraries
Step 3: Load and Explore the Dataset
      Assuming you have a CSV file with women's clothing reviews, the first step is to load the data.
Step 4: Preprocess the Data
      You'll likely need to clean and preprocess the text data before applying the Naive Bayes model. This might involve removing missing values, tokenizing text, and vectorizing it.
Step 5: Split the Data into Training and Test Sets
Step 6: Vectorize the Text Data
     Since Naive Bayes doesn't handle raw text directly, we need to convert text into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
Step 7: Build and Train the Naive Bayes Classifier
Step 8: Make Predictions
Step 9: Evaluate the Model
**Explanation:**
CountVectorizer: Converts the reviews into a matrix of token counts.
MultinomialNB: The Naive Bayes classifier used for text classification.
Accuracy Score: Gives an idea of how accurate the model is.
Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative values.
Classification Report: Displays precision, recall, and F1 score for the model.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Step 1: Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('womens_clothing_reviews.csv')

# Step 2: Preprocess the data
data.dropna(subset=['Review_Text'], inplace=True)
X = data['Review_Text']
y = data['Rating']
y = y.apply(lambda x: 1 if x >= 4 else 0)

# Step 3: Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Vectorize the text data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Step 5: Build and train the model
nb_model = MultinomialNB()
nb_model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

# Step 6: Make predictions
y_pred = nb_model.predict(X_test_vec)

# Step 7: Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')

print('Confusion Matrix:')
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

print('Classification Report:')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
